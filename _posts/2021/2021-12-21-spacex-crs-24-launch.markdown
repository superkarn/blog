"On December 21, 2021, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launched Dragon on the 24th Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-24) mission for NASA from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, completing our 31st and final launch of the year. Dragon separated from Falcon 9's second stage about twelve minutes after liftoff and will autonomously dock to the space station on Wednesday, December 22."
