Tonight I took a picture of [the great conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction).  It is a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn.  The last time these planets were closer than today was in 1623-07-17.  The next time will be 2080-03-15.

In the picture, you can see Jupiter (the bright planet on the left), its four moons Callisto, Io, Ganymeded, and Europa (from top to bottom), Saturn (the bright planet on the right), and possibly some of its moons.
