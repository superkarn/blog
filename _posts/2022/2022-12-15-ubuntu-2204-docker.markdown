To install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04, I followed the instruction from DigitalOcean [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04).  However, when trying to run `docker run hello-world`, I received the following error:

```
docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.
```

This was due to Ubuntu 22.04 having issues with iptables.  To resolve this, I had to [switch it back to legacy version](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/1406#issuecomment-1183487816).


1. Update the iptables and set it back to `iptables-legacy`.
```
sudo update-alternatives --config iptables
```

2. Restart docker service.
```
sudo service docker start
```

3. Confirm that docker is running.
```
sudo service docker status
```
